I am associate professor in Computer Science at the [University Grenoble-Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) (UGA) since September 2004. I am  member of the [ERODS](http://erods.imag.fr) team of the [LIG](http://www.liglab.fr/) laboratory.

I am interested in providing mechanisms and strategies for system observation and system configuration to ensure optimal system dimensioning. My research finds its applications in large-scale systems including multi-core embedded systems, HPC and cloud computing.
